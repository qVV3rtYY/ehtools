# Routersploit

## Overview

Routersploit is an open-source **exploitation** framework specifically designed for embedded devices such as routers, cameras, and IoT devices. It provides a collection of modules that can be used to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, and gain unauthorized access to target devices. Routersploit is similar in concept to Metasploit but focuses on embedded systems.

## Installation

Routersploit can be installed using the following methods:

1. **Using Git and Python 3**:
```bash
apt-get install git python3-pip
git clone https://www.github.com/threat9/routersploit
cd routersploit
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 rsf.py
```

2. **Using Docker**:
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/threat9/routersploit
cd routersploit
docker compose up --build -d
docker attach routersploit
```

## Usage

To start using Routersploit, launch the framework by running:

```bash
python3 rsf.py
```

This will open the Routersploit console where you can interact with the framework.
It works like other exploitation frameworks, such as Metasploit, where you can search for modules, set options, and execute exploits. Below is an execution example of exploiting a vulnerability in a specific router model using the **dsl_2750b_rce** module.

```bash
root@kali:~/git/routersploit$ python3 rsf.py
