# Aircrack-ng

## Overview

Aircrack-ng is a widely used suite of tools for **exploiting** wireless networks. It focuses on monitoring, attacking, testing, and cracking Wi-Fi networks. Aircrack-ng supports various wireless network standards, including WEP, WPA, and WPA2. The suite includes tools for capturing packets, injecting packets, and performing various attacks on wireless networks.
This tutorial will focus on the basic usage of Aircrack-ng for capturing packets and cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK keys.

## Installation

Aircrack-ng can be installed on various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. Visit the [official Aircrack-ng installation guide](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=install_aircrack) for detailed instructions.

## Usage

### Capturing Packets

To capture packets, you need to put your wireless network interface into monitor mode. Use the following commands:

```bash
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start wlan0           # Replace wlan0 with your wireless interface name
```

Once in monitor mode, use `airodump-ng` to visualize nearby wireless networks:

```bash
airodump-ng wlan0mon            # Replace wlan0mon with your monitor mode interface name
```

This will display a list of nearby wireless networks. Note the BSSID and channel of the target network you want to attack and re-execute. The *-w* flag allows you to specify the prefix for the output files where captured packets and metadata will be saved. **Note** that the number of packets captured will be on the column named "#Data" and for different attacks, different amounts of packets are required.

```bash
sudo airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> -c <channel> -w capture wlan0mon
```

### Cracking WEP Keys

To crack a WEP key, you need to capture enough IVs (Initialization Vectors). Once you have captured sufficient packets (around 10,000 to 20,000 IVs), use the following command to crack the WEP key:

```bash
aircrack-ng capture.cap
```

### Cracking WPA/WPA2-PSK Keys

To crack a WPA/WPA2-PSK key, you need to capture sufficient handshake packets (around 2000 - 4000 packets). For this attack a dictionary file must be provided.

```bash
aircrack-ng -w keys.txt capture.cap
```

Examples of wep and wpa cap files can be found in the resources folder, as well as a wordlist containing the password.
