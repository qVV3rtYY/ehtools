# LaZagne

## Overview

LaZagne is an open-source **post-exploitation** tool designed to retrieve stored passwords from various applications on a local machine. It supports a wide range of applications, including web browsers, email clients, database management systems, and more. LaZagne can extract credentials from both Windows and Linux systems.

## Installation

LaZagne can be downloaded from its [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne). To install LaZagne, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
python -m venv .env
.source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For each operating system, there is a folder with the executable.

## Usage

Run laZagne with all modules to extract passwords from all supported applications:

```bash
laZagne.py all
```

For Windows systems:

```ps1
laZagne.exe all
```

Specific modules can be targeted by replacing "all" with the desired module name, such as "browsers" or "email".

```bash
laZagne.py browsers
```

Use the flag *-oN* to save the output to a text file, *-oJ* for JSON format, or *-oA* for all formats.
Use the *--quiet* flag to suppress console output, and the *-v*/*-vv* flags for verbose output.

```ps1
laZagne.exe all -oN
laZagne.exe all -oA -output C:\Users\test\Desktop
```
